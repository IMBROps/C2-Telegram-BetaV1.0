# 🚀 Welcome to **C2 Land: Your Telegram Bot Playground (Part 1)**  

**Where bots obey, commands fly, and encryption is for squares. 🤖**  

---

## ⚡ Before You Begin  
This project is your **C2 gateway drug**. No encryption, no frills—just raw, unfiltered bot fun. Use it wisely… or not. We won’t judge.  

---

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup  

### 1️⃣ Install the Requirements  

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
> Pro tip: If pip throws a tantrum, blame your OS. It’s always the OS’s fault.
### 2️⃣ Create Your Telegram Bot
Chat with BotFather on Telegram.
Type /newbot and give it a name (e.g., C2_Demo_Bot).
Copy the bot token—it’s your golden ticket. Lose it, and you’re screwed.
> ⚠️ Warning: If you mess up the token, your bot will become a sad, lifeless pixel. Don’t be that person.




### 3️⃣ Feed the Token to Your Bot
Navigate to token.txt in your project folder.
Paste your bot token.
Save the file.
> Fun fact: Tokens are like passwords but cooler. Treat them with the respect they deserve.




### 4️⃣ Launch the Bot
```bash
python bot.py
```
> If it crashes, blame the Python gods. They’re fickle creatures.




### 5️⃣ Run the Agent
The agent is your bot’s sidekick. Open it in a target terminal or IDE—just don’t spill coffee on it.




### 6️⃣ Send Commands Like a Boss
In your Telegram chat with the bot, type:

/cmd whoami

> Pro tip: Replace whoami with other commands. Just don’t nuke anything important… yet.

### Troubleshooting (aka “Why Isn’t This Working?”)
Error: “Token not found”  
You forgot to feed the bot its token. Shame on you.

Error: “Command failed”  
Your command sucked. Try again.

Error: “Bot is dead”  
You broke it. Reinstall everything.

### What’s Next?
This is Part 1—your C2 baby steps. In Part 2, we’ll add encryption, stealth, and enough security to make your mom proud.
For now, enjoy the chaos. 🎉




### Disclaimer
This project is for learning purposes only. Use it to prank your cat, not to hack the Pentagon. We’re watching you.
